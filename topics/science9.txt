Chapter 9: Light—Reflection and Refraction

1. Introduction to Light
Light is a form of energy that enables us to see objects.
Without light, we cannot see anything. Light travels from a source and enters our eyes, allowing us to see objects.
Examples of sources of light:
	• Sun (natural source)
	• Bulb (artificial source)
	• Candle
	• Torch
Objects that produce light are called luminous objects.
Example: Sun, bulb
Objects that do not produce light but reflect light are called non-luminous objects.
Example: Moon, book, table
We see non-luminous objects because they reflect light into our eyes.

2. Properties of Light
Light has several important properties.
1. Light travels in a straight line
Light always travels in straight lines. This is called rectilinear propagation of light.
Example:
Shadows are formed because light travels in straight lines.

2. Light can be reflected
Reflection is the bouncing back of light when it strikes a surface.
Example:
Mirror reflects light.

3. Light can be refracted
Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another.
Example:
A pencil appears bent in water.

4. Light travels very fast
Speed of light in vacuum is:
300,000 km/s (3 × 10⁸ m/s)

3. Reflection of Light
Reflection of light is the bouncing back of light when it strikes a surface.
When light falls on a mirror, it reflects back.
Example:
Seeing your image in a mirror.
Important terms:
Incident ray:
Ray of light that falls on the surface.
Reflected ray:
Ray of light that bounces back.
Normal:
An imaginary line drawn perpendicular to the surface.
Angle of incidence (i):
Angle between incident ray and normal.
Angle of reflection (r):
Angle between reflected ray and normal.

4. Laws of Reflection
There are two laws of reflection.

First Law of Reflection
The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection
i = r
Example:
If light strikes at 30°, it reflects at 30°.

Second Law of Reflection
The incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane.
This means they all lie on the same flat surface.

5. Image Formation by Plane Mirror
A plane mirror is a flat, smooth mirror.
Example: Bathroom mirror
When light rays from an object strike a plane mirror, they reflect back and form an image.
The reflected rays appear to come from behind the mirror. This creates an image that we see.
Example:
When you stand in front of a mirror, you see your image behind the mirror.
This image is formed due to reflection of light.

6. Characteristics of Image Formed by Plane Mirror
The image formed by a plane mirror has the following characteristics:
1. Virtual image
The image cannot be obtained on a screen.
2. Erect image
The image is upright, not upside down.
3. Same size as object
Image size is equal to object size.
4. Same distance behind mirror
Image forms at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front.
Example:
If object is 5 cm in front, image is 5 cm behind.
5. Laterally inverted
Left side appears right and right appears left.
Example:
Your right hand appears as left hand in mirror.

7. Spherical Mirrors
Spherical mirrors are mirrors whose reflecting surface is curved.
They are part of a sphere.
There are two types of spherical mirrors:
	1. Concave mirror
	2. Convex mirror
These mirrors are commonly used in daily life.

Important Terms Related to Spherical Mirrors
1. Pole (P):
Center point of mirror.
2. Center of curvature (C):
Center of the sphere from which mirror is formed.
3. Radius of curvature (R):
Distance between pole and center of curvature.
4. Principal axis:
Straight line passing through pole and center of curvature.
5. Focus (F):
Point where reflected rays meet or appear to meet.

8. Concave Mirror
A concave mirror is a mirror that curves inward.
It is also called converging mirror because it converges (brings together) light rays.
Example:
Shaving mirror, dentist mirror

Properties of Concave Mirror
	• Can form real or virtual images
	• Can form inverted or erect images
	• Can form large or small images
Image formed depends on object position.

Uses of Concave Mirror
	• Shaving mirrors
	• Dentist mirrors
	• Headlights of vehicles
	• Solar furnaces
Concave mirrors can produce magnified images.

9. Convex Mirror
A convex mirror is a mirror that curves outward.
It is called diverging mirror because it spreads light rays.

Properties of Convex Mirror
	• Always forms virtual image
	• Always forms erect image
	• Always forms smaller image
Image forms behind the mirror.

Uses of Convex Mirror
	• Rear-view mirrors in vehicles
	• Security mirrors in shops
	• Road safety mirrors
Convex mirrors provide wide field of view.

Topics 10–14: Ray Diagrams, Mirror Formula, Magnification, Refraction, and Refractive Index

10. Ray Diagrams for Spherical Mirrors
Ray diagrams help us understand how images are formed.
There are two important rays:
Ray 1: Parallel ray
A ray parallel to principal axis reflects through focus (F).
Ray 2: Ray through focus
A ray passing through focus reflects parallel to principal axis.
Where these rays meet, image is formed.

Concave Mirror Ray Diagram Cases
Case 1: Object at infinity
Image forms at focus
Image is real, inverted, very small
Case 2: Object beyond center of curvature (C)
Image forms between C and F
Image is real, inverted, small
Case 3: Object at center of curvature (C)
Image forms at C
Image is real, inverted, same size
Case 4: Object between C and F
Image forms beyond C
Image is real, inverted, enlarged
Case 5: Object at focus (F)
Image forms at infinity
Case 6: Object between focus and pole
Image forms behind mirror
Image is virtual, erect, enlarged

Convex Mirror Ray Diagram
For convex mirror, image is always:
	• Virtual
	• Erect
	• Smaller
	• Formed behind mirror

11. Mirror Formula
The mirror formula is:
1/f = 1/v + 1/u
Where:
f = focal length
v = image distance
u = object distance
This formula is used to calculate image position.

12. Magnification
Magnification tells how large or small image is.
Formula:
m = height of image / height of object
Also,
m = v/u
If magnification is:
Positive → image is erect
Negative → image is inverted
If magnification > 1 → image enlarged
If magnification < 1 → image smaller

13. Refraction of Light
Refraction is bending of light when it passes from one medium to another.
Example:
Light bends when passing from air to water.
Reason:
Speed of light changes in different media.
Example:
Straw appears bent in water.

Laws of Refraction
There are two laws:
Law 1:
Incident ray, refracted ray, and normal lie in same plane.
Law 2 (Snell’s Law):
sin i / sin r = constant
This constant is called refractive index.

14. Refractive Index
Refractive index tells how much light bends.
Formula:
Refractive index (n) = speed of light in air / speed of light in medium
Higher refractive index → more bending
Example:
Glass has higher refractive index than air.
