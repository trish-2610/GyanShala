Geography: Resources and Development

1. Introduction
Resources are materials found in the environment that satisfy human needs.
Resources can be:
	• Natural (water, soil, minerals)
	• Human-made (roads, buildings, machines)
Development is the improvement in the quality of life, economy, and living conditions of people.
Resources play a key role in development because they provide raw materials and energy.

2. Types of Resources
Resources are classified in multiple ways:
	1. On the basis of origin:
		○ Biotic – obtained from living things (plants, animals, forests)
		○ Abiotic – obtained from non-living things (minerals, water, air, soil)
	2. On the basis of exhaustibility:
		○ Renewable resources – can be replenished naturally (solar energy, forests)
		○ Non-renewable resources – cannot be replenished easily (coal, petroleum)
	3. On the basis of ownership:
		○ Individual resources – owned by individuals (land, private houses)
		○ Community resources – used by community (roads, parks, forests)
		○ National resources – owned by the nation (minerals, rivers, forests)
		○ International resources – shared by all countries (oceans, atmosphere)

3. Resource Planning
Resource planning is the strategy of using resources efficiently for sustainable development.
	• Helps meet present and future needs
	• Ensures equitable distribution
	• Prevents over-exploitation
Example: India has planned the use of water, minerals, and energy resources in Five-Year Plans.

4. Land Resources and Land Use
Land is an important resource for agriculture, industry, housing, and forests.
	• Arable land: Used for cultivation
	• Forest land: Provides timber, fuel, and biodiversity
	• Barren land: Not suitable for cultivation or habitation
	• Land-use pattern: Shows the distribution of different types of land for various purposes

5. Land Degradation and Conservation
Land degradation occurs due to:
	• Deforestation
	• Overgrazing
	• Mining
	• Urbanization
Effects:
	• Loss of fertility
	• Soil erosion
	• Desertification
Conservation methods:
	• Afforestation
	• Crop rotation
	• Contour plowing
	• Controlled grazing

6. Soil as a Resource
Soil is a vital natural resource:
	• Supports plant growth
	• Provides food for humans and animals
Types of soil in India:
	• Alluvial soil – fertile, found in Indo-Gangetic plains
	• Black soil – good for cotton, found in Deccan plateau
	• Red soil – found in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu
	• Laterite soil – acidic, in Kerala and Karnataka
	• Desert soil – sandy, in Rajasthan
Soil fertility depends on:
	• Minerals
	• Organic matter
	• Moisture content

7. Water Resources
Water is essential for life, agriculture, industry, and power generation.
	• Surface water: Rivers, lakes, reservoirs
	• Groundwater: Wells, tube wells, aquifers
Challenges:
	• Unequal distribution
	• Overuse in irrigation and industries
	• Pollution
Conservation methods:
	• Rainwater harvesting
	• Check dams
	• Watershed management

8. Mineral and Energy Resources
Mineral Resources: Naturally occurring substances extracted from the earth.
	• Metallic minerals: Iron, copper, bauxite
	• Non-metallic minerals: Limestone, mica, gypsum
Energy Resources: Power our industries, homes, and transport
	• Conventional: Coal, petroleum, natural gas, hydroelectricity
	• Non-conventional: Solar, wind, tidal, nuclear
Sustainable use is necessary to prevent depletion.

9. Forest Resources
Forests provide timber, fuel, medicine, and habitat for wildlife.
Types of forests in India:
	• Tropical Evergreen: Dense forests, heavy rainfall, e.g., Western Ghats, Andaman Islands
	• Tropical Deciduous: Shedding leaves in dry season, e.g., Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh
	• Thorn/Scrub Forests: Dry areas, e.g., Rajasthan
	• Montane Forests: Hilly areas, e.g., Himalayas
	• Mangrove Forests: Coastal areas, e.g., Sundarbans
Deforestation: Loss of forest cover due to agriculture, urbanization, and logging.
Conservation methods: Afforestation, community forest management, legal protection of wildlife.

10. Wildlife Resources and Biodiversity
Wildlife includes all animals and plants in their natural habitats.
Importance:
	• Ecological balance
	• Source of medicine
	• Tourist attraction
Threats:
	• Habitat loss
	• Hunting/poaching
	• Pollution
Conservation efforts:
	• Wildlife sanctuaries
	• National parks
	• Biosphere reserves
Example: Jim Corbett National Park, Sundarbans, Gir National Park

11. Water Resource Management
Water is unevenly distributed across regions. Proper management includes:
	• Irrigation projects: Canals, dams (Bhakra Nangal, Hirakud)
	• Rainwater harvesting: Collecting rainwater for future use
	• Watershed management: Conserving soil and water together
	• Flood control and groundwater recharge: Preventing overuse and contamination

12. Mineral Resource Management
Minerals are unevenly distributed. Sustainable management includes:
	• Scientific mining methods
	• Recycling of minerals
	• Restricting mining in ecologically sensitive areas
Example: Bauxite, iron ore, and mica mining areas are carefully managed to prevent environmental damage.

13. Land Resource Management
Proper management of land includes:
	• Crop rotation to maintain soil fertility
	• Terrace farming and contour plowing on slopes
	• Avoiding overgrazing
	• Controlling urban sprawl

14. Energy Resource Management
Energy resources need sustainable use:
	• Non-renewable: Coal, petroleum – should be used efficiently
	• Renewable: Solar, wind, hydro – promoted for sustainable development
Example: Solar energy in Rajasthan and wind energy in Tamil Nadu.

15. Sustainable Development
Sustainable development is the use of resources in a way that meets present needs without compromising future generations.
Principles:
	• Balance economic growth with environmental protection
	• Reduce wastage of resources
	• Encourage renewable resources
	• Promote equality in access
Example: Afforestation, water harvesting, and solar energy projects.
