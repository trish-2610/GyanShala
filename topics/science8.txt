Chapter 8: Heredity and Evolution

1. Introduction to Heredity
Heredity is the process by which characteristics are passed from parents to their offspring.
These characteristics are passed through genes. Genes are present on chromosomes inside the nucleus of cells.
Because of heredity, children resemble their parents in many ways.
Examples:
	• Eye color
	• Hair color
	• Height
	• Skin color
For example, a child may have the same eye color as their parents.
Heredity ensures continuity of characteristics from one generation to the next.

2. Importance of Heredity
Heredity is important for several reasons.
1. Transfer of characteristics
Heredity helps transfer physical and biological traits from parents to offspring.
Example: Hair type, height.
2. Continuity of species
Heredity ensures that species maintain their characteristics over generations.
3. Basis of evolution
Heredity allows variations to be passed on, which helps in evolution.
4. Maintains similarities and differences
Offspring resemble parents but are not exactly identical.

3. Variations
Variation means differences in characteristics among individuals of the same species.
No two individuals are exactly the same, except identical twins.
Examples of variation:
	• Different heights
	• Different eye colors
	• Different skin tones
Variations occur due to differences in genes and environmental factors.
Variation is important because it helps organisms survive in changing environments.
For example, some organisms may survive better in harsh conditions due to variation.

4. Types of Variations
There are two main types of variations:
	1. Inherited variations
	2. Acquired variations

A. Inherited Variations
Inherited variations are variations passed from parents to offspring through genes.
These variations are permanent and can be passed to future generations.
Examples:
	• Eye color
	• Blood group
	• Hair color
Inherited variations play an important role in evolution.

B. Acquired Variations
Acquired variations are variations that develop during the lifetime of an organism.
These variations are caused by environmental factors, lifestyle, and habits.
Examples:
	• Muscles developed through exercise
	• Scars
	• Tanned skin
Acquired variations are not passed to offspring.

5. Mendel and His Experiments
Gregor Mendel is known as the Father of Genetics. He studied how traits are inherited from parents to offspring.
He performed experiments on pea plants because they have clear and easily observable traits.
Examples of traits Mendel studied:
	• Tall and short plants
	• Round and wrinkled seeds
	• Yellow and green seeds
Mendel cross-bred pea plants with different traits and observed how traits appeared in the next generations.
For example, he crossed a tall plant with a short plant.
First generation (F₁ generation):
All plants were tall.
Second generation (F₂ generation):
Both tall and short plants appeared.
This showed that traits are controlled by factors (genes), and some traits are dominant while others are recessive.

6. Genes
Genes are units of heredity that carry information about traits.
Genes are present on chromosomes inside the nucleus.
Each gene controls a specific trait.
For every trait, an organism has two genes:
	• One from the mother
	• One from the father
Genes determine characteristics such as:
	• Height
	• Eye color
	• Hair color
Genes pass information from parents to offspring.

7. Dominant and Recessive Traits
Traits can be dominant or recessive.

Dominant Trait
A dominant trait is the trait that appears in the offspring even if only one gene is present.
It hides the recessive trait.
Example:
Tallness is dominant over shortness.
It is represented by capital letters (T).

Recessive Trait
A recessive trait appears only when both genes are recessive.
It is hidden if a dominant gene is present.
Example:
Shortness is recessive.
It is represented by small letters (t).

Example:
TT → Tall
Tt → Tall
tt → Short

8. Laws of Inheritance
Mendel gave laws that explain inheritance of traits.

Law of Dominance
This law states that dominant traits appear in the offspring, while recessive traits remain hidden.
Example:
Tall trait hides short trait.

Law of Segregation
This law states that genes separate during gamete formation.
Each gamete receives only one gene.
These genes combine again during fertilization.

9. Punnett Square
Punnett square is a diagram used to predict inheritance of traits.
It shows possible gene combinations in offspring.
Example:
Cross between Tt and Tt
	T	t
T	TT	Tt
t	Tt	tt
Results:
	• TT → Tall
	• Tt → Tall
	• Tt → Tall
	• tt → Short
Ratio:
3 Tall : 1 Short
This is called monohybrid cross.
Punnett square helps predict probability of traits.

10. Sex Determination in Humans
Sex determination is the process that decides whether a baby will be male or female.
In humans, sex is determined by special chromosomes called sex chromosomes.
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes:
	• 22 pairs are autosomes
	• 1 pair is sex chromosomes
Sex chromosomes are:
	• XX in females
	• XY in males

Role of Male and Female in Sex Determination
Female produces only one type of gamete: X
Male produces two types of gametes: X and Y
During fertilization:
	• X (female) + X (male) = XX (Female child)
	• X (female) + Y (male) = XY (Male child)
Therefore, the father determines the sex of the child.

11. Evolution
Evolution is the process of gradual change in living organisms over millions of years.
Evolution results in the formation of new species from existing species.
Evolution occurs due to variations and natural selection.
Example:
Modern humans evolved from ancestors over millions of years.
Evolution helps organisms adapt to their environment.

12. Natural Selection
Natural selection is the process by which organisms with favorable traits survive and reproduce, while others do not.
This concept was explained by Charles Darwin.
According to natural selection:
	• Organisms with useful variations survive
	• Organisms without useful variations may die
Example:
Giraffes with longer necks could reach food easily and survived better.
Natural selection leads to evolution.

13. Speciation
Speciation is the process of formation of new species.
It happens when groups of the same species become separated and develop different characteristics over time.
Causes of speciation:
	• Geographical isolation
	• Genetic changes
	• Environmental differences
Example:
Animals separated by mountains or rivers may evolve into different species.

14. Evidence of Evolution
Scientists use different types of evidence to support evolution.

A. Fossils
Fossils are preserved remains of ancient organisms.
They show how organisms looked in the past.
Fossils help understand evolutionary history.
Example:
Dinosaur fossils

B. Homologous Organs
Homologous organs have similar structure but different functions.
Example:
	• Human hand
	• Whale flipper
	• Bat wing
This shows common ancestry.

C. Analogous Organs
Analogous organs have different structure but same function.
Example:
	• Wings of birds
	• Wings of insects
This shows different evolutionary origin.

D. Vestigial Organs
Vestigial organs are organs that have no function but were useful in ancestors.
Example:
	• Appendix in humans
	• Wisdom teeth
These show evolution.
