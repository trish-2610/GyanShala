Chapter 10: The Human Eye and the Colourful World 

1. The Human Eye
The human eye is a sense organ that helps us see objects around us. It works like a camera. It captures light and sends signals to the brain, which helps us see images.
The eye allows us to see different colors, shapes, sizes, and distances.
The main functions of the human eye are:
	• To collect light from objects
	• To focus light on the retina
	• To convert light into electrical signals
	• To send signals to the brain
The brain then understands these signals and forms the image.

2. Structure of the Human Eye
The human eye has several important parts.
(a) Cornea
The cornea is the transparent front part of the eye. Light enters the eye through the cornea.
Functions:
	• Protects the eye
	• Helps in refraction of light

(b) Iris
The iris is the colored part of the eye. It controls the amount of light entering the eye.
It adjusts the size of the pupil.
Example:
	• Bright light → pupil becomes small
	• Dim light → pupil becomes large

(c) Pupil
The pupil is the small opening in the center of the iris.
Function:
	• Allows light to enter the eye

(d) Eye Lens
The eye lens is a transparent convex lens.
Function:
	• Focuses light on retina
	• Forms image

(e) Retina
The retina is the light-sensitive screen at the back of the eye.
Function:
	• Image is formed here
	• Converts light into signals

(f) Optic Nerve
The optic nerve carries signals from retina to brain.
The brain interprets signals and we see the image.

3. How the Human Eye Forms Image
The process of image formation:
	1. Light enters through cornea
	2. Passes through pupil
	3. Eye lens focuses light
	4. Image forms on retina
	5. Retina sends signals to brain
	6. Brain forms final image
The image formed on retina is:
	• Real
	• Inverted
	• Small
But brain makes it appear straight.

4. Power of Accommodation
Accommodation is the ability of the eye to change focal length to see objects at different distances.
The eye lens changes shape using muscles.
	• To see near objects → lens becomes thick
	• To see distant objects → lens becomes thin
This helps us see clearly at all distances.

5. Near Point and Far Point
Near Point
The minimum distance at which eye can see clearly.
For normal human eye:
Near point = 25 cm

Far Point
The maximum distance at which eye can see clearly.
For normal eye:
Far point = infinity

6. Defects of Vision
Sometimes eye cannot see clearly. These problems are called defects of vision.
Main defects:
	• Myopia (Near-sightedness)
	• Hypermetropia (Far-sightedness)
	• Presbyopia

7. Myopia (Near-sightedness)
In this defect, person can see near objects clearly but cannot see distant objects clearly.
Cause:
Image forms in front of retina.
Reason:
	• Eye lens too powerful OR
	• Eyeball too long
Correction:
Using concave lens

8. Hypermetropia (Far-sightedness)
In this defect, person can see distant objects clearly but cannot see near objects clearly.
Cause:
Image forms behind retina.
Reason:
	• Eye lens too weak OR
	• Eyeball too short
Correction:
Using convex lens

9. Presbyopia
Presbyopia is a defect of vision in old age. In this defect, a person cannot see nearby objects clearly.
Cause:
As people grow older, the eye muscles become weak and the eye lens loses its flexibility. Because of this, the lens cannot change its shape properly.
Result:
The eye cannot focus light correctly on the retina.
Correction:
It is corrected using bifocal lenses.
Bifocal lenses have two parts:
	• Upper part → concave lens (for distant vision)
	• Lower part → convex lens (for near vision)
Example:
Old people use reading glasses.

10. Refraction of Light through a Prism
A prism is a transparent triangular glass object.
When white light passes through a prism, it bends due to refraction.
The light bends twice:
	1. When entering the prism
	2. When leaving the prism
This bending causes separation of colors.

11. Dispersion of Light
Dispersion is the splitting of white light into its seven colors.
These seven colors are:
V – Violet
I – Indigo
B – Blue
G – Green
Y – Yellow
O – Orange
R – Red
This is called VIBGYOR.
Reason:
Each color bends differently because each has different wavelength.
Violet bends the most.
Red bends the least.
Example:
Rainbow formation

12. Spectrum
The band of seven colors formed after dispersion is called spectrum.
It is formed when white light passes through prism.
Order of colors:
Violet → Indigo → Blue → Green → Yellow → Orange → Red
Example:
Rainbow is a natural spectrum.

13. Recombination of Light
Recombination is the process of joining the seven colors back into white light.
This can be done using another prism.
When dispersed light passes through second prism, it combines and becomes white light again.
This proves that white light is made of seven colors.

14. Scattering of Light
Scattering is the spreading of light in different directions when it hits small particles.
Examples of particles:
	• Dust
	• Smoke
	• Air molecules
Short wavelength colors scatter more.
Blue light scatters more than red light.

15. Why is the Sky Blue?
The sky appears blue due to scattering of light.
When sunlight enters atmosphere, it hits air molecules.
Blue light has shorter wavelength, so it scatters more.
Because blue light scatters in all directions, sky appears blue.

16. Why Does the Sun Appear Red at Sunrise and Sunset?
At sunrise and sunset, sunlight travels longer distance in atmosphere.
Most of the blue light gets scattered away.
Only red light reaches our eyes.
Red light has longer wavelength and scatters less.
So sun appears red.

17. Tyndall Effect
Tyndall effect is the scattering of light by small particles in air.
It makes the path of light visible.
Examples:
	• Sunlight entering dusty room
	• Car headlights in fog
	• Torch light in smoke
