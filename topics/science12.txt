Chapter 12: Magnetic Effects of Electric Current

1. Magnet and Magnetism
A magnet is a material that attracts iron, nickel, and cobalt.
Example:
	• Bar magnet
	• Horseshoe magnet
Magnets have two poles:
	• North pole (N)
	• South pole (S)
Important properties:
	• Like poles repel each other
	• Unlike poles attract each other

2. Magnetic Field
The area around a magnet where its force can be felt is called magnetic field.
If you place a compass near a magnet, the needle moves. This shows magnetic field is present.

Magnetic Field Lines
Magnetic field is shown using magnetic field lines.
Properties:
	• Field lines go from North pole to South pole
	• They form closed curves
	• They never intersect each other
	• Closer lines mean stronger magnetic field

3. Magnetic Field Around a Current-Carrying Conductor
When electric current flows through a wire, it produces a magnetic field around it.
This was discovered by scientist Hans Christian Oersted.
Example:
If current flows in a wire, compass needle near it deflects.
This proves that electric current produces magnetic field.

4. Direction of Magnetic Field (Right-Hand Thumb Rule)
The right-hand thumb rule helps find direction of magnetic field.
Rule:
	• Hold wire in right hand
	• Thumb shows direction of current
	• Fingers show direction of magnetic field
This helps determine field direction.

5. Magnetic Field Around a Circular Loop
When current flows through a circular loop, magnetic field is produced around it.
Properties:
	• Field lines are circular near wire
	• Field becomes stronger at center
More current → stronger magnetic field
More loops → stronger magnetic field

6. Magnetic Field Around a Solenoid
A solenoid is a coil of many circular loops of wire.
It produces strong magnetic field when current flows through it.
Solenoid behaves like a bar magnet.
It has:
	• North pole
	• South pole
Inside solenoid, magnetic field is strong and uniform.

7. Electromagnet
An electromagnet is a magnet made using electric current.
It is made by passing current through a coil wrapped around iron core.
When current flows → magnet is formed
When current stops → magnet disappears

Uses of Electromagnets
	• Electric bell
	• Electric motor
	• Cranes to lift iron
	• Relays

8. Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor
When a current-carrying conductor is placed in magnetic field, it experiences a force.
This force can move the conductor.
This principle is used in electric motors.

Direction of Force (Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule)
Rule:
Stretch three fingers of left hand:
	• Thumb → direction of force
	• Forefinger → direction of magnetic field
	• Middle finger → direction of current
All three are perpendicular.

9. Electric Motor
An electric motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.
It works on the principle that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force.
This force causes the conductor to move, and this movement produces mechanical energy.

Construction of Electric Motor
Main parts:
	1. Coil (armature) – current flows through it
	2. Magnet – produces magnetic field
	3. Split ring (commutator) – changes direction of current
	4. Battery – provides electric current
	5. Brushes – connect coil with battery

Working of Electric Motor
	• Current flows through coil
	• Magnetic field produces force on coil
	• Coil rotates
	• Split ring changes direction of current
	• Coil keeps rotating
This produces continuous motion.

Uses of Electric Motor
	• Electric fan
	• Mixer grinder
	• Washing machine
	• Water pump

10. Electromagnetic Induction
Electromagnetic induction is the process of producing electric current using magnetic field.
When a conductor moves in magnetic field, current is produced.
This was discovered by Michael Faraday.

Example
Moving a magnet inside a coil produces current.
This principle is used in generators.

11. Electric Generator
An electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
It works on electromagnetic induction.

Construction of Generator
Main parts:
	• Coil
	• Magnet
	• Slip rings
	• Brushes
	• Shaft

Working of Generator
	• Coil rotates in magnetic field
	• Magnetic field produces current
	• Current flows through external circuit

Types of Generators
	1. AC Generator – produces alternating current
	2. DC Generator – produces direct current

Uses of Generator
	• Power plants
	• Electricity generation
	• Backup generators

12. Fleming’s Right-Hand Rule
This rule helps find direction of induced current.
Rule:
Stretch three fingers of right hand:
	• Thumb → direction of motion
	• Forefinger → direction of magnetic field
	• Middle finger → direction of current
All are perpendicular.

13. Domestic Electric Circuit
Domestic electric circuit supplies electricity to homes.
Electricity comes from power station to houses.
Main components:
	• Live wire
	• Neutral wire
	• Earth wire
	• Switch
	• Fuse

Live Wire
Carries current to appliance.
Color: Red or brown

Neutral Wire
Returns current to source.
Color: Black or blue

Earth Wire
Protects from electric shock.
Color: Green

14. Electric Fuse
Fuse is a safety device.
It protects appliances from excess current.
Fuse wire melts if current is too high.
This stops the circuit and prevents damage.

15. Earthing
Earthing is safety method to prevent electric shock.
Excess current goes to ground through earth wire.
This protects people and appliances.

16. Short Circuit and Overloading
Short Circuit
Occurs when live wire touches neutral wire.
This causes very high current.
It can cause fire.

Overloading
Occurs when too many devices are connected.
This increases current and can damage circuit.
