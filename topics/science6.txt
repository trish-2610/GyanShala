Chapter 6: Control and Coordination

1. Introduction to Control and Coordination
Control and coordination is the process by which the body controls its activities and coordinates different functions.
Our body has many organs that work together. To function properly, these organs must work in a coordinated manner. Control and coordination ensure that the body responds properly to changes in the environment.
For example:
	• Pulling your hand away when touching a hot object
	• Walking, running, or writing
	• Responding to light, sound, or smell
This control is done by two main systems:
	• Nervous system
	• Endocrine system
The nervous system provides quick responses, while the endocrine system provides slow and long-lasting responses.

2. Nervous System
The nervous system controls and coordinates all activities of the body. It helps the body respond to stimuli.
A stimulus is any change in the environment that causes a response.
Example:
Heat, light, sound, smell, and touch are stimuli.
The nervous system performs three main functions:
1. Receiving information
Sense organs receive information from the environment.
2. Processing information
The brain and spinal cord process the information.
3. Responding to information
Muscles and glands respond accordingly.
Example:
When you touch a hot object, the nervous system quickly sends signals, and you remove your hand.

3. Structure of Neuron
A neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system. It is also called a nerve cell.
Neurons carry messages in the form of electrical impulses.
A neuron has three main parts:
1. Dendrites:
Dendrites receive signals from other neurons or sense organs.
2. Cell body (Cyton):
It contains the nucleus and controls the activities of the neuron.
3. Axon:
Axon carries impulses away from the cell body to muscles or other neurons.
The axon may be covered with a myelin sheath, which helps in faster transmission of impulses.
Neurons are specialized to transmit information quickly.

4. Types of Nervous System
The human nervous system is divided into two main parts:
	1. Central Nervous System (CNS)
	2. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)

A. Central Nervous System (CNS)
The central nervous system consists of:
	• Brain
	• Spinal cord
Functions:
	• Controls body activities
	• Processes information
	• Makes decisions
The brain is the main control center of the body.
The spinal cord connects the brain to the rest of the body.

B. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
The peripheral nervous system consists of nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body.
Functions:
	• Carries messages to and from CNS
	• Controls voluntary and involuntary actions
Example:
Movement of hands and legs.

5. Brain and Its Parts
The brain is the main control center of the nervous system. It controls all activities of the body such as thinking, movement, breathing, and emotions.
The brain is located inside the skull, which protects it from injury.
The brain has three main parts:
	• Forebrain
	• Midbrain
	• Hindbrain

A. Forebrain
The forebrain is the largest part of the brain. It controls thinking, intelligence, memory, emotions, and voluntary actions.
Functions of forebrain:
	• Thinking and decision making
	• Memory and learning
	• Control of voluntary movements
	• Processing sensory information
Example: Writing, reading, and solving problems.
The cerebrum is the main part of the forebrain.

B. Midbrain
The midbrain connects the forebrain and hindbrain.
Functions:
	• Controls reflex movements of eyes and head
	• Responds to visual and sound stimuli
Example: Turning your head towards sound.

C. Hindbrain
The hindbrain controls involuntary actions.
Main parts of hindbrain:
	• Cerebellum
	• Pons
	• Medulla
Functions:
Cerebellum:
	• Controls balance and posture
	• Coordinates muscle movements
Medulla:
	• Controls breathing
	• Controls heartbeat
These actions happen automatically.

6. Spinal Cord
The spinal cord is a long tube-like structure that connects the brain to the rest of the body.
Functions:
	• Carries messages between brain and body
	• Controls reflex actions
It is protected by the vertebral column (backbone).

7. Reflex Action
Reflex action is a quick, automatic response to a stimulus without conscious thinking.
Example:
	• Pulling hand away from hot object
	• Blinking eyes when dust enters
Reflex actions help protect the body from harm.
These actions are controlled by the spinal cord.
Reflex actions are very fast.

8. Reflex Arc
Reflex arc is the path followed by nerve impulses during reflex action.
Parts of reflex arc:
	1. Receptor – detects stimulus
	2. Sensory neuron – carries impulse to spinal cord
	3. Spinal cord – processes impulse
	4. Motor neuron – carries impulse to muscle
	5. Effector – muscle or gland that responds
Example:
Touching a hot object → hand moves away.

9. Voluntary and Involuntary Actions
Voluntary Actions
Voluntary actions are actions that are under our control.
Example:
	• Walking
	• Writing
	• Speaking
These actions are controlled by the brain.

Involuntary Actions
Involuntary actions are actions that occur automatically without our control.
Example:
	• Heartbeat
	• Breathing
	• Digestion
These actions are controlled by the medulla and autonomic nervous system.

10. Endocrine System
The endocrine system controls body activities using hormones.
It consists of glands called endocrine glands.
These glands release hormones directly into the blood.
Hormones are chemical messengers.
They control:
	• Growth
	• Development
	• Metabolism
	• Reproduction
Endocrine system works slower than nervous system but effects last longer.

11. Major Endocrine Glands and Their Functions
Pituitary Gland
Called the master gland.
Controls other glands and growth.

Thyroid Gland
Controls metabolism.
Uses iodine to produce hormone called thyroxine.
Deficiency causes goitre.

Pancreas
Produces insulin.
Insulin controls blood sugar level.
Deficiency causes diabetes.

Adrenal Gland
Produces adrenaline.
Controls stress and emergency responses.
Example:
Faster heartbeat during fear.

Testes (in males)
Produces testosterone.
Controls male characteristics.

Ovaries (in females)
Produces estrogen.
Controls female characteristics.

12. Coordination in Plants
Plants also show control and coordination but do not have a nervous system.
Plants respond to stimuli such as light, water, gravity, and touch.
These responses are called tropisms.

Types of Tropisms
Phototropism: Response to light
Example: Plant bends towards light
Geotropism: Response to gravity
Example: Roots grow downward
Hydrotropism: Response to water
Example: Roots grow towards water
Thigmotropism: Response to touch
Example: Climbing plants wrap around support

Plant Hormones
Plants use hormones for coordination.
Examples:
Auxin – promotes growth
Gibberellin – promotes stem growth
Cytokinin – promotes cell division
Abscisic acid – slows growth
