Chapter 5: Life Processes 

1. What are Life Processes?
Life processes are the basic activities that living organisms perform to stay alive. These processes are essential for maintaining life and keeping the body functioning properly. Without these processes, no organism can survive.
All living organisms, whether plants, animals, or microorganisms, perform certain important functions such as nutrition, respiration, transportation, and excretion. These functions help the organism obtain energy, use that energy, transport substances, and remove waste materials.
For example, humans need food to get energy, oxygen to release energy from food, blood to transport nutrients, and organs like kidneys to remove waste.
These activities together are called life processes.
Examples of life processes include:
	• Nutrition – obtaining food
	• Respiration – releasing energy from food
	• Transportation – carrying substances inside the body
	• Excretion – removing waste
These processes are necessary to maintain and repair the body and to support growth and survival.

2. Nutrition
Nutrition is the process by which organisms obtain food and use it to get energy for growth, repair, and maintenance of the body.
All living organisms need energy to perform various activities such as movement, growth, repair of damaged parts, and maintaining body functions. This energy comes from food.
Food provides:
	• Energy
	• Materials for growth
	• Materials for repair
	• Protection against diseases
For example, humans eat food like rice, fruits, and vegetables to get energy and nutrients.
Plants also need food, but they prepare their own food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water.
Thus, nutrition is an essential life process for all living organisms.

3. Types of Nutrition
There are two main types of nutrition:
	1. Autotrophic Nutrition
	2. Heterotrophic Nutrition

A. Autotrophic Nutrition
Autotrophic nutrition is the mode of nutrition in which organisms make their own food from simple substances like carbon dioxide and water using sunlight.
Organisms that prepare their own food are called autotrophs.
Examples:
	• Green plants
	• Algae
Plants prepare food by a process called photosynthesis.
In photosynthesis, plants use:
	• Sunlight (energy source)
	• Carbon dioxide (from air)
	• Water (from soil)
	• Chlorophyll (green pigment in leaves)
Food produced is glucose.
Equation of photosynthesis:
Carbon dioxide + Water → Glucose + Oxygen
(In presence of sunlight and chlorophyll)
This process also releases oxygen, which is important for animals and humans.

B. Heterotrophic Nutrition
Heterotrophic nutrition is the mode of nutrition in which organisms cannot make their own food and depend on other organisms for food.
Organisms that depend on others for food are called heterotrophs.
Examples:
	• Humans
	• Animals
	• Fungi
	• Some bacteria
Humans eat plants and animals to get energy.
Types of heterotrophic nutrition include:
	1. Holozoic nutrition – Humans, animals
	2. Saprophytic nutrition – Fungi feed on dead matter
	3. Parasitic nutrition – Parasites feed on living organisms
Example:
Leech feeds on blood (parasite)

4. Photosynthesis (Nutrition in Plants)
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants prepare their own food using carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and chlorophyll.
It is an example of autotrophic nutrition.
Plants make food mainly in their leaves. Leaves contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which helps in absorbing sunlight.
Plants take:
	• Carbon dioxide from the air through tiny pores called stomata
	• Water from the soil through roots
	• Sunlight from the sun
	• Chlorophyll from leaves
Using these, plants produce glucose (food) and release oxygen.
Word equation:
Carbon dioxide + Water → Glucose + Oxygen
(In presence of sunlight and chlorophyll)

Steps of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis occurs in three main steps:
Step 1: Absorption of sunlight
Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight.
Step 2: Conversion of light energy into chemical energy
Light energy is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.
Step 3: Formation of glucose
Hydrogen combines with carbon dioxide to form glucose.
Oxygen is released as a by-product.

Importance of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is important because:
	• It provides food for plants
	• It provides food for animals and humans indirectly
	• It releases oxygen needed for respiration
	• It maintains balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
Without photosynthesis, life would not exist on Earth.

5. Nutrition in Humans
Humans follow heterotrophic nutrition. Humans cannot make their own food and depend on plants and animals.
The process of nutrition in humans includes five steps:
	1. Ingestion – taking food into the body
	2. Digestion – breaking down food
	3. Absorption – nutrients enter blood
	4. Assimilation – using nutrients for energy and growth
	5. Egestion – removing undigested food
These steps occur in the digestive system.

6. Human Digestive System
The digestive system is made up of organs that help in digestion of food.
Main organs of digestive system:
	• Mouth
	• Food pipe (Oesophagus)
	• Stomach
	• Small intestine
	• Large intestine
	• Anus
Associated glands:
	• Salivary glands
	• Liver
	• Pancreas
Each organ has a specific function.

7. Process of Digestion in Humans
A. Mouth
Digestion begins in the mouth.
Functions of mouth:
	• Teeth break food into small pieces
	• Saliva mixes with food
	• Saliva contains enzyme called salivary amylase
Salivary amylase breaks starch into sugar.
Tongue helps in mixing food and swallowing.

B. Oesophagus (Food Pipe)
The oesophagus carries food from mouth to stomach.
Food moves through oesophagus by peristalsis.
Peristalsis is the wave-like movement of muscles.

C. Stomach
The stomach is a muscular organ.
Functions of stomach:
	• Stores food
	• Mixes food with digestive juices
	• Begins digestion of proteins
Stomach releases:
	• Hydrochloric acid (HCl) – kills bacteria
	• Pepsin enzyme – digests proteins

D. Small Intestine
The small intestine is the main site of digestion and absorption.
It receives juices from:
	• Liver (bile juice)
	• Pancreas (pancreatic juice)
Functions:
	• Completes digestion
	• Absorbs nutrients into blood
The inner surface has villi, which increase absorption.

E. Large Intestine
Functions:
	• Absorbs water
	• Forms solid waste (faeces)
Waste is removed through anus.

8. Respiration
Respiration is the process by which food (glucose) is broken down using oxygen to release energy.
This energy is used by the body to perform various activities such as movement, growth, repair, and maintaining body temperature.
Respiration occurs in all living organisms, including plants and animals.
The energy released is stored in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), which is called the energy currency of the cell.
Word equation of respiration:
Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy
Respiration takes place inside the cells, mainly in structures called mitochondria.

9. Types of Respiration
There are two types of respiration:
	1. Aerobic respiration
	2. Anaerobic respiration

A. Aerobic Respiration
Aerobic respiration is respiration that occurs in the presence of oxygen.
In this process:
	• Oxygen is used
	• Large amount of energy is released
	• Carbon dioxide and water are produced
Example:
Humans perform aerobic respiration.
Equation:
Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy

B. Anaerobic Respiration
Anaerobic respiration occurs in the absence of oxygen.
In this process:
	• Oxygen is not used
	• Less energy is released
Example:
Yeast performs anaerobic respiration.
Equation:
Glucose → Alcohol + Carbon dioxide + Energy
In humans, during heavy exercise, muscles perform anaerobic respiration and produce lactic acid, which causes muscle cramps.

10. Human Respiratory System
The respiratory system helps in breathing and exchange of gases.
Main parts of respiratory system:
	• Nose
	• Nasal cavity
	• Trachea (windpipe)
	• Bronchi
	• Lungs
	• Alveoli

Functions of each part:
Nose:
Air enters through the nose. It filters dust and germs.
Trachea:
It is a tube that carries air to the lungs.
Bronchi:
Trachea divides into two bronchi, each going to one lung.
Lungs:
Main organs of respiration.
Alveoli:
Tiny air sacs where exchange of gases occurs.
Oxygen enters blood and carbon dioxide leaves blood.

11. Breathing vs Respiration
Breathing and respiration are different processes.
Breathing:
	• Physical process
	• Taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide
	• Occurs in lungs
Respiration:
	• Chemical process
	• Breakdown of glucose to release energy
	• Occurs in cells
Breathing supplies oxygen needed for respiration.

12. Transportation in Humans
Transportation is the process of carrying food, oxygen, water, and waste materials to different parts of the body.
In humans, transportation is done by the circulatory system.
Main parts of circulatory system:
	• Heart
	• Blood
	• Blood vessels
Functions:
	• Carries oxygen
	• Carries nutrients
	• Removes waste
	• Maintains body temperature

13. Human Heart
The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body.
It is located in the chest, slightly towards the left.
The heart has four chambers:
	• Right atrium
	• Right ventricle
	• Left atrium
	• Left ventricle
The heart pumps blood continuously.

Functions of Heart
	• Pumps oxygenated blood to body
	• Pumps deoxygenated blood to lungs
	• Maintains circulation

Double Circulation
Humans have double circulation.
Blood passes through heart twice in one cycle:
	1. Heart → Lungs → Heart
	2. Heart → Body → Heart
This ensures efficient supply of oxygen.

14. Blood
Blood is a fluid connective tissue that transports substances throughout the body. It carries oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste materials.
Blood consists of four main components:
1. Red Blood Cells (RBCs):
Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. They contain haemoglobin, which is a red pigment that binds with oxygen.
2. White Blood Cells (WBCs):
White blood cells help in fighting infections and protect the body from diseases.
3. Platelets:
Platelets help in clotting of blood. They prevent excessive bleeding when there is an injury.
4. Plasma:
Plasma is the liquid part of blood. It transports food, hormones, carbon dioxide, and waste materials.

15. Blood Vessels
Blood vessels are tubes that carry blood throughout the body.
There are three main types of blood vessels:
1. Arteries:
Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body. Their walls are thick and elastic.
Example: Aorta is the main artery.
2. Veins:
Veins carry oxygen-poor blood from the body back to the heart. They have valves to prevent backflow of blood.
3. Capillaries:
Capillaries are very thin blood vessels. They connect arteries and veins. Exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste occurs through capillaries.

16. Transportation in Plants
Plants also need to transport water, minerals, and food to different parts.
Plants have special tissues called vascular tissues:
	• Xylem
	• Phloem

Xylem
Xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves.
Water moves upward due to:
	• Root pressure
	• Transpiration pull

Phloem
Phloem transports food from leaves to other parts of the plant.
This process is called translocation.
Food moves in both upward and downward directions.

17. Excretion in Humans
Excretion is the process of removing waste materials from the body.
Waste materials include:
	• Urea
	• Carbon dioxide
	• Excess water
	• Salts
These wastes are harmful and must be removed.
Excretion helps maintain balance inside the body.

18. Human Excretory System
The excretory system removes waste from the body.
Main parts:
	• Kidneys
	• Ureters
	• Urinary bladder
	• Urethra

Functions of each part:
Kidneys:
Filter blood and remove waste in the form of urine.
Ureters:
Carry urine from kidneys to urinary bladder.
Urinary bladder:
Stores urine.
Urethra:
Removes urine from body.

Nephron
Nephron is the basic unit of kidney.
Functions of nephron:
	• Filters blood
	• Removes waste
	• Forms urine
Each kidney contains millions of nephrons.

Excretion in Plants
Plants also remove waste materials.
Plants remove waste by:
	• Releasing oxygen through stomata
	• Storing waste in leaves
	• Removing waste when leaves fall
	• Releasing waste through roots
Plants do not have a special excretory system like humans.
