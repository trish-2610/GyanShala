Chapter 13: Our Environment 

1. Environment
Environment is everything that surrounds us.
It includes both living and non-living things.
Examples:
Living components:
	• Plants
	• Animals
	• Humans
	• Microorganisms
Non-living components:
	• Air
	• Water
	• Soil
	• Sunlight
All living organisms depend on environment for survival.

2. Ecosystem
An ecosystem is a system formed by interaction between living organisms and their environment.
It includes:
	• Living components (biotic components)
	• Non-living components (abiotic components)
Example:
Forest ecosystem
Pond ecosystem
Desert ecosystem
In ecosystem, all organisms depend on each other.

3. Components of Ecosystem
There are two main components:
(a) Biotic Components (Living Things)
These include:
	• Plants
	• Animals
	• Humans
	• Bacteria
They are living organisms.

(b) Abiotic Components (Non-living Things)
These include:
	• Air
	• Water
	• Soil
	• Sunlight
	• Temperature
They support life.

4. Types of Organisms in Ecosystem
There are three types:
	1. Producers
	2. Consumers
	3. Decomposers

(a) Producers
Producers are organisms that make their own food using sunlight.
Example:
Plants
Plants use photosynthesis to make food.
They are the main source of energy.

(b) Consumers
Consumers are organisms that depend on producers or other consumers for food.
Examples:
Humans, animals
Types of consumers:
Herbivores – eat plants
Example: cow, deer
Carnivores – eat animals
Example: lion, tiger
Omnivores – eat plants and animals
Example: humans, bear

(c) Decomposers
Decomposers break down dead plants and animals.
Examples:
Bacteria, fungi
They recycle nutrients back into soil.
They help maintain balance in ecosystem.

5. Food Chain
Food chain is a sequence of organisms where each organism eats the previous one.
Example:
Grass → Deer → Tiger
Grass is eaten by deer.
Deer is eaten by tiger.
This shows transfer of energy.

6. Trophic Levels
Each step in food chain is called trophic level.
Example:
Grass → Deer → Tiger
Trophic levels:
1st level → Producer (grass)
2nd level → Herbivore (deer)
3rd level → Carnivore (tiger)
Energy decreases at each level.

7. Food Web
Food web is a network of interconnected food chains.
Example:
Grass → Rabbit → Fox
Grass → Deer → Tiger
Food webs provide multiple food sources.
This makes ecosystem more stable.

8. Energy Flow in Ecosystem
Energy flows from sun to producers and then to consumers.
Flow:
Sun → Plants → Animals → Humans
Energy decreases at each step.
Only about 10% energy transfers to next level.
This is called 10% law.

9. 10% Law of Energy Transfer
The 10% law states that only 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next level.
The remaining 90% energy is lost as heat, movement, and life processes.
Example:
Sun → Plants → Deer → Tiger
If plants have 1000 units energy:
Deer gets only 100 units
Tiger gets only 10 units
This is why food chains are usually short.

10. Biological Magnification (Biomagnification)
Biological magnification is the increase in concentration of harmful chemicals at each trophic level.
Harmful chemicals enter food chain and accumulate in organisms.
These chemicals are not easily broken down.

Example
Pesticides enter plants → eaten by insects → eaten by birds → eaten by humans
Concentration increases at each level.
This is dangerous for top consumers.
Example chemical:
DDT (pesticide)

11. Ozone Layer
The ozone layer is a layer of ozone gas present in the upper atmosphere.
It protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun.
Without ozone layer, UV rays can damage living organisms.

Importance of Ozone Layer
	• Protects humans from skin cancer
	• Protects plants and animals
	• Protects environment

12. Ozone Depletion
Ozone depletion means thinning of ozone layer.
Main cause:
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
CFCs are found in:
	• Refrigerators
	• Air conditioners
	• Aerosol sprays
These destroy ozone layer.

Effects of Ozone Depletion
	• Skin cancer
	• Eye damage
	• Harm to plants
	• Environmental damage

13. Waste
Waste is unwanted material produced by humans.
Examples:
	• Plastic
	• Food waste
	• Paper
	• Chemicals
Waste must be properly managed.

14. Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable Substances
Biodegradable Substances
These can be broken down by microorganisms.
Examples:
	• Food waste
	• Paper
	• Leaves
They do not harm environment.

Non-Biodegradable Substances
These cannot be broken down easily.
Examples:
	• Plastic
	• Glass
	• Metals
They remain in environment for long time.
They cause pollution.

15. Waste Management
Waste management means proper handling of waste.
Methods:
(a) Reduce
Use less plastic.
(b) Reuse
Use items again.
Example:
Reuse bottles
(c) Recycle
Convert waste into useful products.
Example:
Recycling paper
This is called 3R principle:
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
