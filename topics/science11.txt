Chapter 11: Electricity

1. Electric Current
Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor.
In simple words, when electrons move through a wire, electric current is produced.
Example:
When you switch on a bulb, current flows and the bulb glows.

Definition
Electric current is defined as the amount of charge flowing through a conductor in unit time.
Formula:
I = Q / t
Where:
I = current
Q = charge
t = time

Unit of Electric Current
SI unit of current is Ampere (A).
1 Ampere means 1 Coulomb of charge flows in 1 second.

Instrument to Measure Current
Ammeter is used to measure electric current.
It is always connected in series.

2. Electric Circuit
An electric circuit is a closed path through which electric current flows.
Main components of a circuit:
	• Battery (source of energy)
	• Wire (conductor)
	• Switch (to open or close circuit)
	• Bulb (device that uses electricity)

Open Circuit
If switch is OFF, circuit is open and current does not flow.

Closed Circuit
If switch is ON, circuit is closed and current flows.

3. Electric Potential and Potential Difference
Electric potential is the amount of work done to move a unit charge from infinity to a point.
Potential difference is the difference in electric potential between two points.
It pushes current through the circuit.

Formula
V = W / Q
Where:
V = potential difference
W = work done
Q = charge

Unit
SI unit is Volt (V)

Instrument Used
Voltmeter is used to measure potential difference.
It is connected in parallel.

4. Ohm’s Law
Ohm’s Law states that:
The current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends, provided temperature remains constant.
Formula:
V = IR
Where:
V = voltage
I = current
R = resistance

5. Resistance
Resistance is the property of a conductor to oppose the flow of current.
Example:
Thin wire has more resistance than thick wire.

Factors Affecting Resistance
Resistance depends on:
	1. Length of wire
More length → more resistance
	2. Thickness of wire
More thickness → less resistance
	3. Material of wire
Different materials have different resistance
	4. Temperature
Higher temperature → higher resistance

Unit of Resistance
SI unit is Ohm (Ω)

6. Resistor
Resistor is a device used to control current in a circuit.
It provides resistance.
Symbol:
Zig-zag line

7. Rheostat
Rheostat is a variable resistor.
It is used to change resistance and control current.
Example:
Fan speed regulator

8. Ohm’s Law Graph
Graph between voltage (V) and current (I) is a straight line.
This shows that voltage is directly proportional to current.
Slope of graph gives resistance.

9. Combination of Resistors in Series
When resistors are connected one after another in a single path, they are said to be connected in series.
In series combination, current is same in all resistors.
Example:
Battery → Resistor 1 → Resistor 2 → Resistor 3 → Back to battery

Total Resistance in Series
Total resistance is equal to sum of individual resistances.
Formula:
R = R₁ + R₂ + R₃
This means total resistance increases in series.

Example
If
R₁ = 2 Ω
R₂ = 3 Ω
Total resistance = 2 + 3 = 5 Ω

Characteristics of Series Combination
	• Current is same everywhere
	• Total resistance increases
	• Voltage divides among resistors

10. Combination of Resistors in Parallel
When resistors are connected side by side, they are said to be connected in parallel.
In parallel combination, voltage is same across all resistors.

Formula for Parallel Combination
1/R = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃
Total resistance decreases in parallel.

Example
If
R₁ = 2 Ω
R₂ = 2 Ω
1/R = 1/2 + 1/2
1/R = 1
R = 1 Ω

Characteristics of Parallel Combination
	• Voltage is same across each resistor
	• Total resistance decreases
	• Current divides among resistors

11. Heating Effect of Electric Current
When electric current flows through a conductor, heat is produced. This is called heating effect of electric current.
Reason:
Resistance opposes flow of current, producing heat.
Example:
	• Electric heater
	• Iron
	• Electric stove

Formula for Heat Produced
H = I²Rt
Where:
H = heat
I = current
R = resistance
t = time

12. Electric Power
Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is used.
Formula:
P = VI
Where:
P = power
V = voltage
I = current

Other formulas:
P = I²R
P = V²/R

Unit of Electric Power
SI unit is Watt (W)
1 kilowatt (kW) = 1000 W

13. Electric Energy
Electric energy is the total energy used by electrical devices.
Formula:
Energy = Power × Time
E = P × t

Unit of Electric Energy
SI unit = Joule (J)
Commercial unit = kilowatt-hour (kWh)

14. Commercial Unit of Electricity
Commercial unit of electricity is kilowatt-hour (kWh).
1 kWh = 1 unit
This is the unit used in electricity bills.

Meaning of 1 kWh
If a 1000 W device runs for 1 hour, it uses 1 kWh energy.
Example:
100 W bulb used for 10 hours
Energy = 100 × 10 = 1000 Wh = 1 kWh

15. Electric Fuse
Electric fuse is a safety device.
It protects circuit from excessive current.
Fuse melts if current is too high and stops the circuit.
Example:
Used in homes

16. Advantages of Parallel Circuits in Homes
House wiring uses parallel circuits because:
	• Each appliance gets same voltage
	• If one appliance fails, others still work
	• Devices can be controlled separately
