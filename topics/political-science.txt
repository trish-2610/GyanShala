Political Science: Power-Sharing

1. Introduction
Power-sharing means the distribution of power among different organs, levels, and groups of people in a democracy.
Purpose:
	• Prevent misuse of power
	• Protect democracy
	• Promote equality and cooperation
Example: In India, power is shared between the Union and State governments.

2. Why Power-Sharing is Necessary
Power-sharing reduces conflict in society and ensures stability.
Reasons:
	1. Diverse societies have different social, economic, and cultural groups.
	2. No single group should dominate others.
	3. Promotes social harmony and national unity.
Example: Belgium has multiple linguistic groups—Dutch-speaking and French-speaking. Power-sharing helps maintain peace.

3. Types of Power-Sharing
There are three main types:
	1. Horizontal power-sharing
	2. Vertical power-sharing
	3. Power-sharing among social groups

4. Horizontal Power-Sharing
Horizontal power-sharing occurs among different organs of government.
Example:
	• Legislature → makes laws
	• Executive → implements laws
	• Judiciary → interprets laws
Each organ has checks and balances to prevent misuse of power.

5. Vertical Power-Sharing
Vertical power-sharing occurs between different levels of government: central, state, and local.
Example:
	• Union (Central) government
	• State government
	• Local government (Panchayati Raj and Municipalities)
Benefits:
	• Brings government closer to people
	• Prevents concentration of power

6. Power-Sharing Among Social Groups
In multi-ethnic or diverse societies, power-sharing among social groups is essential.
Example: Belgium
	• Dutch-speaking majority in Flanders
	• French-speaking majority in Wallonia
Solution:
	• Communities have autonomy in cultural, educational, and language matters
	• Each group participates in government

7. Case Study: Belgium
Belgium faced tension between Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities.
Solution:
	• Powers of government divided between communities and regions
	• Each group had representation in legislature and government
	• Promoted peaceful coexistence

8. Case Study: Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese majority dominated Tamils, leading to conflict.
Lesson:
	• Ignoring power-sharing can create political instability and conflict
	• Proper power-sharing ensures democracy and peace

9. How India Shares Power
India is a diverse country with multiple languages, religions, and cultures.
To maintain democracy and unity, India shares power in three main ways:
	1. Horizontally – among different organs of government
	2. Vertically – between central and state governments
	3. Among social groups – through representation and safeguards

10. Horizontal Power-Sharing in India
Horizontal power-sharing ensures that no single organ of government becomes too powerful.
Example:
	• Legislature: Makes laws (Parliament/Council)
	• Executive: Implements laws (Prime Minister, Council of Ministers)
	• Judiciary: Interprets laws (Supreme Court, High Courts)
Each organ has the power to check the others. This is called checks and balances.

11. Vertical Power-Sharing in India
Vertical power-sharing divides power between different levels of government.
Levels:
	1. Union (Central) Government – Handles national matters (defense, foreign affairs, currency)
	2. State Governments – Handle state matters (police, agriculture, health)
	3. Local Governments – Handle local matters (Panchayati Raj, municipalities, town councils)
Benefits:
	• Local problems are solved locally
	• Prevents concentration of power at the top

12. Power-Sharing Among Social Groups in India
India recognizes its diversity and provides power-sharing among social groups:
	1. Representation in legislature – Reservation for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Parliament and State Assemblies
	2. Participation in executive – Members of minorities can hold positions in government
	3. Independent judiciary – Ensures rights of all communities are protected
This protects minorities and promotes equality.

13. Example of Representation in India
	• Scheduled Castes and Tribes – Reserved seats in Parliament and State Assemblies
	• Women – Reservation in Panchayati Raj Institutions
	• Minorities – Constitutional safeguards and participation in government

14. Advantages of Power-Sharing in a Democracy
	1. Reduces conflict – Groups feel included and represented
	2. Promotes cooperation – Encourages compromise and negotiation
	3. Protects minorities – Prevents domination by majority
	4. Ensures stability – Democracy remains strong
	5. Brings government closer to people – Local issues are addressed effectively
